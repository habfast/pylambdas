# pylambdas

A simplistic lambda interpreter.

It's not a pure lambda-expression interpreter in the sense that:

- it doesn't interpret the raw lambda language, but an abstract syntax tree
- it has more then just lambdas

In main.py, you can see a few working example including a fibonacci sequence. 

Issues:

- I still need to fix an issue that deals with negative number multiplication.
